## Outline
* Introducing Jupyter Notebooks - Data analysis made simple
* Data access with Jupyter Notebooks from different data repositories
* Introducing Jupyter widgets - Make your data analysis and visualisation interactive
* Jupyterlab, JupyterHub, ... - Getting to know the Jupyter environment


## At the end of this short course
* you **hopefully have an idea about the benefits of Jupyter notebooks** and understand the Jupyter environment better
* you got an **overview of different data platforms to retrieve large volumes of environmental data** (meteorological, climate, Earth Observation)
* You got an **overview of different python libraries to efficiently access and process Big Earth Data**
* You were shown some **options to make your analysis / visualization interactive**
